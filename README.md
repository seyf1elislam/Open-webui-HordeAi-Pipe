# **Open-WebUI-HordeAI-Pipe (Experimental)**  
An experimental implementation of HordeAI as an Open-WebUI pipe.  

> **Note:** This function is currently under development and may not work as expected.  
> Feel free to suggest modifications or improvements.  

## **Issues**  
- Models that take longer than 3 minutes to respond are problematic. Open-WebUI treats these cases as timeouts, closing the connection and retrying the request.
